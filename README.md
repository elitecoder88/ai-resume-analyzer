## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**React**
A leading open-source JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces with reusable components and a virtual DOM—ideal for fast, single-page applications.

**React Router v7**
A powerful routing library for React applications. Supports nested routes, data loading, error boundaries, code splitting, and server-side rendering (SSR), with a smooth upgrade path from v6.

**Puter.com**
An advanced, open-source internet OS built for speed, extensibility, and privacy. Acts as a secure personal cloud where users can store files, apps, and games accessible from anywhere.

**Puter.js**
A lightweight client-side SDK that brings serverless authentication, file storage, database access, and AI (GPT, Claude, DALL·E, OCR, and more) directly into your frontend—no backend needed.

**Tailwind CSS**
A utility-first CSS framework that enables fast UI development by applying low-level utility classes directly in HTML.

**TypeScript**
A strongly-typed superset of JavaScript that improves code quality and tooling, making it easier to maintain and scale large applications.

**Vite**
A lightning-fast build tool and dev server powered by native ES modules. It offers instant startup, HMR (Hot Module Replacement), and optimized production builds via Rollup.

**Zustand**
A minimal and efficient state management library for React. Provides global state without the boilerplate or context providers, using hooks and selective subscriptions for performance.
